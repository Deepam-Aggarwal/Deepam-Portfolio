                    The app is created using the Google's Appsheet as a part of my personal curiosity. The app uses
                    the <cite>7788 rows+</cite> long dataset for its functioning. The app displays the list of all Netflix's
                    shows, dramas, movies, webseries with their details like name, genre, duration, cast, added on and more.<br /><br />
                    Features of the app:<br />
                    The app has about the app information, share option and login or account creation option on the pannel
                    which can be accessed by clicking on the top left three lines.<br />The app displays the lists of content
                    available on the Netflix and renders it on the homepage.<br />The app has search bar on top of the homepage
                    for easy access and as soon as the end user starts typing anything in search pannel, the app starts showing the results,
                    so the old practice of showing results only on pressing the search icon or enter is not required.<br />
                    On clicking on any content card the user can view the details about his/her content of choice.<br />
                    At the bottom there is option of switching from homepage to assistant mode in which the user can search about
                    what he/she is looking for using the search bar or using voice search.<br />My app can work on any phone, tablet,
                    desktop.<br />The app is made keeping the internet shortage in mind, thats why it uses mordern caches and storage
                    practices to still deliver its content if the user has no internet connection available.<br /><br /> Current Scope:<br />
                    The app is made up keeping the current situation in mind, remaining at homes during this pandemic can be full of
                    boredom and thus to help with that the OTT platforms has a lot of things to view so for knowing what content
                    they offer, getting details of any series, episodes, movies or even deciding what to view my app is there for your help.<br /><br />
                    Future scope:<br />Adding other OTT platforms details and content, more features like sharing any content, adding trailers
                    can make this app wonderful.<br /><br />Note:<br />As any other app it also has its own policy, shares your locale, timezone, device model
                    and app usage information with the creater.<br />The app may require access to storage for working without the internet 
                    connection.<br />It don't collect any other information at all.
